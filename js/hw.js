// I. VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES

// A. Q & A
// 1. We use the '=' sign to assign a value to a variable
// 2. To change the value of a variable, simply re-state the variable and assign it the new value
// 3. To assign an existing variable to a new variable, assign the new variable's value to be the existing variable
// 4. Declaring a variable brings it into existence; assigning a value means using the equals sign to give the variable a value;
// definitions of a variable can change, i.e. a variable can be re-defined by assigning it a new value
// 5. Pseudocoding is just writing out the steps of the process you are trying to code in plain english. This helps
// organize your thoughts before trying to translate them into code.
// 6. 75-95% planning, 10-25% coding
